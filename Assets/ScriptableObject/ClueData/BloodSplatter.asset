  - content: The body is the anchor, but the room tells the story. This wall... it's
      a Jackson Pollock in crimson.
  - content: It's not a smear, it's a fine, arterial spray. That tells me two things.
  - content: 'One: his heart was still beating a drum solo when the wound was exposed.'
  - content: 'Two: the spray is high, arcing down. He was standing when he took the
      hit. A high-velocity slash, fast and fatal.'

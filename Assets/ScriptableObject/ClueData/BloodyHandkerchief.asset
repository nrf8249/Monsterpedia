  lines:
  - content: The trash... paper towels on top... and jackpot.
  - content: A bread knife, right from the bar. Why would a knife be in the bathroom?
  - content: Seems as though someone is trying to cover something up.
  - content: Wait, there's more in here, under the knife.
  - content: "A balled-up handkerchief. It's stained dark. Smells like old pennies...
      copper. But the cloth itself... that's different. \r\n"
  - content: Sweet, spicy. Cloves. Someone with an expensive habit was wiping their

  lines:
  - content: This wasn't a simple bar fight. These... the metal legs... they're bent
      out of shape. Warped. Like someone grabbed them and just... squeezed.
  - content: Takes more than a few too many whiskeys to do that. That's raw, supernatural
      strength.
  - content: ...And... lemon. Faint scent of wood polish. Someone was wiping these
      down. Trying to clean up a clue.

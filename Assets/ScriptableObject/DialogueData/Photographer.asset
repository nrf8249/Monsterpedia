        I take the 'before' shots, you know, before you types start poking around
        and stirring up the ectoplasm.

      content: You're a natural, kid. That's the right idea, anyway. Find a lie,
        hit 'em with the truth. But, uh, maybe save the real accusations for the
        people inside the bar. They're gonna be a lot less friendly than I am.

      content: Good luck, detective. Don't get yourself hexed.
